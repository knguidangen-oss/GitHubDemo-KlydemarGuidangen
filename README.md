1. What challenges did you face, and how did you overcome them? 
  * The main problem that I encountered is the account of Juan Miguel in my github account, I cannot remove his account so I just let it be.
  * Second is the push, pull and commit, this confused me a lot cause I thought commit automatically updates your github.
2. How can cloud hosting make your project more useful to others?
  *  Cloud hosting could be more useful to others by showing your codes and teaching them through comments.
  *  Could be access on different device simultaneously making collaboration easier.
